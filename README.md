# GitHub README Auto Update

Automatically updates your GitHub profile `README.md` with your latest repositories, activities, and details. This tool fetches data from your GitHub account using the GitHub API and synchronizes it to your profile.

---

## How It Works

- Fetches your public repositories, including their names, descriptions, languages, and last updated dates.
- Compares the current `README.md` content with your remote GitHub profile.
- Updates the profile `README.md` if there are any changes.
- Pushes the updated `README.md` to your GitHub repository.
